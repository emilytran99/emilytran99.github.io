I've been putting writing this off because it still feels surreal, but I graduated! I am officially an alumna of Tufts University, with a Bachelor's in Computer Science and a minor in Foreign Policy Analysis! 

Reflecting back on my time at Tufts, I am proud of the impact I've made on my community. I served on the executive board of Women in Computer Science for two and a half years, and worked on the Tufts Women in Tech Conference for three! I've been a Teaching Assistant or Fellow for almost my entire time at Tufts, seven semesters in total - shoutout to my favorite classes, COMP 11 and 105. And of course, I got to work on the Emerging Scholars Program during senior year and help it grow beyond the pilot semester. 

I will miss the Tufts CS community dearly, but I am also excited for this next phase. I've moved back to New York, and will be returning to the Restaurants team at Square full time!
