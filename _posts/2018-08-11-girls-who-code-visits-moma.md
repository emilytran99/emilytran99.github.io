On Thursday, we visited the Museum of Modern Art after hours - it was great that the MOMA was only a few blocks from the BlackRock offices so we could avoid the subway during rush hour. We were lucky enough to talk with CTO Diana Pan, about how the museum utilizes technology for its operations. She spoke about how curators have begun redefining what they consider art as technology becomes all-encompassing in our lives; perhaps one day tweets might be in the MOMA! We also explored the ["City Dreams" exhibit by Congolese artist Bodys Isek Kingelez](https://www.moma.org/calendar/exhibitions/3889){:target="_blank"}, which featured incredibly detailed models of utopian cities built from everyday objects. My favorite part was the VR experience, which placed us in the *Ville Fantome* model and let us explore as if we were actually in the city!
