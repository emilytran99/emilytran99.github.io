Very excited to announce that I have accepted an offer to be a Software Engineering Intern for Intuit at their Mountain View office for Summer 2019! I am really looking forward to my first technical interning experience, as well as my first extended stay in the heart of Silicon Valley. It'll be a great way to get a deep dive into what industry is like after hearing about it from so many perspectives for such a long time. I will be working there from May 29th to August 16th.
