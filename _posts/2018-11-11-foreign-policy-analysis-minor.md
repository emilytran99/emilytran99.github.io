I've declared a Foreign Policy Analysis minor under the Political Science Department here at Tufts. I found that in addition to studying CS, I was still very invested in learning about international relations but without the constraints of the very rigid IR major. I am excited to ground my technical learning in computer science with some global context! After taking mostly coding classes for the entirety of freshman year, I found that I missed the humanities, so I am excited to include these again in my college curriculum with the minor. For next semester, I have enrolled in Introduction to International Relations, as well as Cybersecurity and Cyberwar, which is cross-listed between the CS & IR departments.
