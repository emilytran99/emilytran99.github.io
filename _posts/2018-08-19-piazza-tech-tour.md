For the past three days, I've been in Palo Alto! I was lucky enough to be selected for the 2018 Summer Piazza Tech Tour, so they flew me out to visit Airbnb, Piazza, Roche, and Lyft. Going to such different companies gave me a good perspective on what kind of environment I'd like to work in, and what I'd want from an internship. Between the tours and panels, I realized I'd like an internship where I can build something that will make an impact, and learn about various parts of the company so I can understand what different teams do. I also met nine other incredibly passionate and insightful CS college students from all over the country, all with varied stories and perspectives. I had a great time bonding with all of them, and on a suggestion from a friend, I tried a delicious chocolate cronut from Happy Donuts. All in all, it was a great first trip to the Bay!
