I've joined the Jumbocode MA STEM team! Jumbocode is a club at Tufts that provides nonprofit organizations with software tools for free so they can focus on better serving their communities. The MA STEM team will be working with the Central Massachusetts STEM Network, an affiliate of the Worcester Polytechnic Institute's STEM Education Center. We are building them a web app using React.js, Ruby on Rails, and PostgreSQL that will allow students to visualize STEM careers and identify resources that can help them build those careers. We hope to personalize the steps they can take towards a STEM career based on their location and interests. I will be dabbling in both the front and back end, and I'm excited to work on this project!
