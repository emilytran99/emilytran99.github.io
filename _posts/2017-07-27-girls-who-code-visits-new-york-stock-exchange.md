title: girls who code visits new york stock exchange
---
For our latest field trip organized by our host company BlackRock, we went to the closing bell ceremony at the New York Stock Exchange. 13 girls that we randomly selected went up on the podium and ended trading for the weekend! One girl even got to ring the bell, and joined history by signing this book that everyone else who has ever rung the bell also signed. I was surprised that she just had to press a button to ring the bell, which was much louder than I'd anticipated - I'd been expecting a Liberty Bell-esque bell that you'd have to hit. We also talked to a Designated Market Maker about what his job looks like, and learned about how technology drives the trades.
