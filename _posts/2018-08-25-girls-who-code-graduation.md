title: girls who code graduation!
---
The twenty girls I've been working with all summer officially graduated from the Summer Immersion Program yesterday! After a little ceremony where they received their certificates, they presented their final projects. The projects were the fruition of the last two weeks of the program, and are the culmination of everything they've learned this summer. It was incredible to see how much each girl had grown over the course of only seven weeks, both technically and professionally. My personal favorite was titled "Winning the War on Wildfires," and combined both software and hardware; they used servo motors, an Arduino board, breadboards, Adafruit Playgrounds, and an LED lightbulb to triangulate the location of their model fire. I saw a lot of myself in them, and I am so excited to see the places they'll go!
