For this semester, I have two unexpected updates! I will be Teaching Fellow for COMP 11: Introduction to Computer Science; with the two other TFs, I will be overseeing the undergraduate teaching staff and helping the professors with logistics and curriculum planning. I will also be serving as Co-President of the Tufts Women in Computer Science club, since the previously elected president will be abroad. I am looking forward to leading two different aspects of the CS community here at Tufts.
