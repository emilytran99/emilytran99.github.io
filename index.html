I am a senior at Tufts University majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Foreign Policy Analysis. I'm interested in software engineering, cybersecurity, and product management. I find space exploration, film, and Asian-American race relations fascinating, and I like to dabble in photography and Photoshop. I am also a big fan of the subway and cooking shows! I am based in New York City and Boston.
